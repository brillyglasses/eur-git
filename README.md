# Git Tutorial - Erasmus University Rotterdam

Welcome to the Git tutorial! This course is designed as a follow-up course for the ["Introduction to Git"](https://jjengelberts.github.io/eur-git-101), as presented during a lunch break session on October 31st 2018. Before continuing, please check the [slides of that course](https://github.com/jjengelberts/eur-git-101/blob/master/presentation/Introduction%20to%20Git.pdf).

For this follow-up course, it is assumed that you have Git installed on your computer, understand the content of the ["Introduction to Git"](https://jjengelberts.github.io/eur-git-101) course, and have created an account on [Github](https://github.com/join) for simulating a real life collaboration project during the hands-on.

Since the focus of this course is on hands-on, it relies heavily the conceptual sandbox tool ["Learn Git Branching"](https://learngitbranching.js.org). This tool focusses on concepts. Therefore, certain commands (like "git add"), and certain topics (like "Conflicts") will be shown during by the instructor, and you are invited to type along. All commands he typed will be available, after the course, [here](https://github.com/jjengelberts/eur-git/blob/master/hands_on.md).

Finally, the slides (that are merely used for the introduction and as a guide through the hands-on session) can be found [here](https://github.com/jjengelberts/eur-git/blob/master/presentation/Git%20Tutorial.pdf).
